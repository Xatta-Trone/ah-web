Funded Research Projects (Key Researcher)
---

- 🧩 **Incorporating Safe System Approach into the NCHRP Report 500 Series**  
  *National Cooperative Highway Research Program (2024 – 2026) | Budget: $700,000*  
  - Conducted an extensive literature review of the NCHRP 500 series emphasis areas, along with objectives and strategies.  
  - Conducted an online survey of state DOTs and MPOs to evaluate their current understanding and application of Safe System principles.  
  - Contributed to designing and developing a searchable electronic toolkit, providing key information on countermeasure selection and its connection with SSA.

- 🚶 **Traffic Analysis Practices for Non-Motorized Modes (Vulnerable Road Users)**  
  *National Cooperative Highway Research Program (2024 – 2025) | Budget: $55,000*  
  - Documented current traffic analysis practices for non-motorized modes by reviewing methodologies, tools, guidelines, and outputs, and identifying challenges and limitations through a comprehensive literature review.  
  - In the process of conducting surveys and follow-up interviews with state DOTs to investigate integration protocols, funding mechanisms, and administrative procedures, developing case examples, and proposing research to address identified gaps.

- 🎯 **Evaluation of NJDOT Hardened Traffic Paint Markings and Stripes Performance**  
  *New Jersey Department of Transportation (2023 – 2025) | TXST Budget: $83,000*  
  - Utilized the YOLO v8 model for image analysis and identification, determining the best-performing model for accurate classification and performance assessment.  
  - Evaluated variations in retroreflectivity values across different routes to assess the performance of hardened traffic paint markings.

- ⚖️ **Increasing Equity in Traffic Safety**  
  *AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety (2023 – 2025) | TXST Budget: $60,000*  
  - Investigated traffic safety disparities across demographic groups (race, ethnicity, age, and road user categories) and conducted a neighborhood-level evaluation using crash data, demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility data from Washington, Ohio, and Texas to identify areas with pronounced inequities.  
  - Identified evidence-based interventions and developed practical recommendations aligned with the Safe System approach to promote equitable access to road safety resources and mitigate traffic safety disparities.

- 💡 **Reduce Pedestrian Fatal Crashes in Louisiana by Improving Lighting Conditions**  
  *Louisiana Transportation Research Center (LTRC) | 2020–2022*  
  - Developed a data-driven Association Rules Mining (ARM) model to analyze and identify differences in pedestrian crash patterns under varying lighting conditions.  
  - Investigated police-reported pedestrian crash reports to identify contributing factors, assess crash circumstances, and evaluate the role of lighting conditions in pedestrian safety outcomes.

- 🚧 **Impact of Center Line Rumble Strips and Shoulder Rumble Strips on All Roadway Departure Crashes in Louisiana Two-lane Highways**  
  *Louisiana Transportation Research Center (LTRC) | 2019–2020*  
  - Evaluated the impact of center line and shoulder rumble strips on roadway departure crashes on Louisiana's two-lane highways using the Empirical Bayes (EB) method to assess crash reduction effectiveness.  
  - Utilized time series analysis methods to examine the temporal trends of roadway departure crashes and assess the long-term effectiveness of center line and shoulder rumble strips as safety countermeasures.
