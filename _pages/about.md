<!-- ## Welcome
🚀 **Traffic Safety Officer | Transportation Safety Specialist | AI & Data Science in Transportation | Crash Analysis & Machine Learning**   -->
## **About Me**  
I am a **Transportation Safety Specialist** with extensive experience in **crash data analysis, predictive modeling, and roadway safety improvements**. Currently, I serve as a **Traffic Safety Officer at the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT)**, where I work on implementing data-driven solutions to minimize traffic-related incidents and enhance road safety.  

Previously, I worked as a **Post-Doctoral Researcher at the Artificial Intelligence in Transportation (AIT) Lab, Texas State University**, where I focused on **leveraging AI, machine learning, and hybrid statistical approaches** to analyze crash patterns and inform transportation policies.  

With **over 5 years of research experience**, I have contributed to **nationally funded projects** for organizations such as the **Louisiana Transportation Research Center (LTRC), Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (LaDOTD), National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP), and AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety**. My research is centered on improving safety for vulnerable road users—including **pedestrians, older adults, and young drivers**—as well as assessing the impact of **connected and autonomous vehicles on transportation safety**.  

## **Research Interests**  
🔹 **Crash Data Analysis & Safety Modeling** – Identifying crash patterns using data-driven techniques.  
🔹 **Machine Learning & Hybrid Approaches** – Developing predictive models for roadway safety.  
🔹 **Safe System Approach (SSA) & Policy Development** – Implementing evidence-based safety interventions.  
🔹 **Emerging Technologies & Transportation Safety** – Exploring connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) applications.  
🔹 **Geospatial Analysis & Big Data in Transportation** – Leveraging GIS tools for safety risk assessment.
